## Sentence Structure
### Word Order
Avanzata does not have strict word order rules. However, there are a couple rules to be aware of:
- In sentences where a subject acts on an object, the order must be either subject-object-verb, or if the context is clear, verb-object-subject.
- The words should be arranged in a way that connects. Two words that relate to each other should have an unrelated word in between them unless the meaning is still clear.

### Omission of Articles, Pronouns, and the verb 'to be'
- The definite article (English 'the', Avanzata 'a') and the indefinite article (English 'a/an', Avanzata 'ge') can be used as frequently as in Italian or French, or as rarely as never. This is up to the speaker's discretion.
- The verb 'to be' ('ser') cannot be omitted in its infinitive form, but when conjugated to is/are ('e'), it is omitted by default.
- Avanzata is a pro-drop language, meaning pronouns can be omitted when they can be clearly inferred from context.
