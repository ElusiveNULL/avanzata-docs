## Syllable Stress  
Avanzata has detailed syllable stress rules designed to accommodate the mora timing system. Avanzata makes a distinction between syllables, which follow the traditional definition, and morae, which are each an equal length of time. Some syllables may be worth multiple morae. The syllable stress rules are defined as follows:

- In two and three syllable words, the first syllable is stressed by default.  
- In four syllable words, the second syllable is stressed by default.  
- In five syllable words, the third syllable is stressed by default.

There are many words where the stressed syllable is overridden by a syllable containing a specific vowel \+ consonant combination, and the syllableâ€™s worth changes to two morae. There are four types of stress-overriding syllables, and a higher priority type takes precedence over lower ones. So in a word with type 1 and type 2, the type 2 would be the stressed syllable and the only one worth two morae. When there are multiple instances of the highest type in a word, the last one takes precedence. So in a 4-syllable word where the syllable types go 1-0-2-2, the last syllable would be the stressed syllable and the only one worth two morae.

- Type 1: A syllable containing a vowel followed by an M or N  
- Type 2: A syllable containing a vowel followed by an R  
- Type 3: A syllable containing an extended vowel
- Type 4: The second-to-last syllable of any word with suffixes -ata and -ate, or the last syllable of a word conjugated in the 'you' form (singular or plural)
- Type 5: The syllable before a geminated consonant
