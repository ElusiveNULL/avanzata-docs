## Pronunciation  
### Vowels
There are a few key concepts that must be understood to properly pronounce vowels in Avanzata:

- Vowel extension: Certain vowels can be extended to change syllable stress to that vowel’s syllable, similar to the equivalent use of accents in most Romance languages. Vowel extension is done by adding a specific vowel after the vowel to be extended. The added vowel can either be anywhere from silent to fully pronounced in its own syllable depending on the speaker’s wishes.  
- Vowel reduction: When speaking Avanzata, one can choose to reduce any vowel. A reduced vowel is pronounced quietly and with less effort. In the suffixes \-ata and \-ate, the final ‘a’ or ‘e’ is always reduced unless the speaker wants to intentionally emphasize the vowel for whatever reason.  
- Vowel merging: If a vowel is followed by another vowel, even if they’re in separate words, they can be combined and pronounced in a single syllable worth one mora. This can only happen with two vowels in a row. If there are three vowels in a row, they would have to be split into separate syllables. Also, if the same vowel occurs twice in a row, the second one can be dropped and does not count towards the two-vowel limit for merging.

The pronunciation of each vowel in Avanzata is as follows:

- A: Pronounced close to the ‘a’ in English ‘water’ (IPA: /a/) by default. Changes to a schwa like the ‘u’ in English ‘run’ (IPA: /ə/) when reduced. Can be extended by appending an E.  
- E: Pronounced close to the ‘e’ in English ‘bed’ (IPA: /e/) by default. Changes to a schwa when reduced. Can be extended by appending an I.  
- I: Pronounced close to the ‘i’ in English ‘liter’ by default. Changes to a sound close to the ‘i’ in English ‘lit’ (IPA: /ɪ/) when reduced. Can be extended by appending an E. Silent when placed in between a C and another vowel.
- O: Pronounced close to the ‘o’ in English ‘story’ (IPA: /o/) by default. Changes to be pronounced like U when reduced. Can be extended by appending a U.  
- U: Pronounced close to the ‘u’ in English ‘tuba’. Does not change significantly when reduced. Cannot be extended.

### Basic consonants
Basic consonants make only one sound in all situations. The pronunciation of each basic consonant in Avanzata is as follows:  

- D: Pronounced close to English D. IPA: /t/  
- H: Pronounced like English H. IPA: /h/  
- K: Pronounced like English K. IPA: ⟨kʰ⟩  
- P: Pronounced like English P. IPA: ⟨pʰ⟩  
- S: Pronounced as English S. IPA: /s/  
- T: Pronounced like English T. IPA: ⟨tʰ⟩  

### Complex consonants
Some consonants in Avanzata can make more than one sound depending on the situation they’re in. These are called complex consonants. The pronunciation of each complex consonant is as follows:

- B: Pronounced close to English B (IPA: /p/) in most cases. Pronounced without fully closing lips when it’s in between two vowels (IPA: /β/).  
- C: Pronounced like the ‘ch’ in English ‘chair’ (IPA: /tʃ/) when followed by an I, pronounced like K (IPA: /k/) in all other situations.  
- F: Pronounced halfway between English F and English H at the end of a syllable or before a U (IPA: /ɸ/). Pronounced as English F (/f/) in all other situations.  
- G: Pronounced close to English G (IPA: /k/) in most cases. Pronounced without the tongue touching the roof of the mouth when it’s in between two vowels (IPA: /ɣ/)  
- L: Pronounced like English L (IPA: /l/) in most cases. Pronounced as a W when preceding another consonant.  
- M: Pronounced like English M (IPA: /m/). Silent when preceding another consonant, in which case the vowel before it is nasalized.  
- N: Pronounced like English N (IPA: /n/). Silent when preceding another consonant, in which case the vowel before it is nasalized.  
- R: Pronounced as L at the beginning of a word. Pronounced like ‘t’ in English ‘atom’ at the beginning of a syllable in the middle of a word. Silent after a vowel unless followed by another vowel. Pronounced as H when following another consonant.  
- V: Can be pronounced as an F or B, or anything in between, up to the speaker’s discretion.
- Z: Pronounced like English S (IPA: /s/) in most cases. Pronounced as the 'ts' in English 'cats' (IPA: /ts/) when preceded by an N.

### Consonant Reduction/Omission
When multiple consonants occur in a row, only the last one is fully pronounced, with some exceptions:

- If the last consonant in the consonant chain is an R, the preceding consonant is pronounced in addition to the R, but the R is pronounced as an H. Example: “Preparer” would be pronounced as /phepaɾˈeː/  
- If the first consonant is an N or M, it is still not pronounced, but the preceding vowel is nasalized.  
- If the first consonant is an L, it is pronounced, but like the English W.
