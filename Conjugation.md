### Suffixes
Avanzata contains some suffixes that change the properties of a word. They are listed as follows:
- nei: Negates a verb or adjective
- -me: Marks an adverb
- -ata: Marks past participle form. In other words, that an action is completed.
- -ate: Plural form of -ata.
- -le: Indicates past tense.
- -go: Marks past perfect tense.

Examples:

- Perfectame: Perfectly
- Delitata: Deleted, that which is deleted
- Delitate: Those which are deleted

Note that there is no suffix for future tense. Future tense is marked by adding the word 'ue' before a verb. Thus, 'ue' can be translated as 'will' in 'I will see'.

### Plural vs singular
To make a noun plural, change the trailing A to an E. If the word does not end in an A, add an E to the end.

Example:
- Persona: Person
- Persone: People
