## Overview  
Avanzata is a constructed language with primarily borrowed vocabulary and a unique pronunciation and grammar system. The language is designed with a few goals in mind:

- Consistency \- Every word in Avanzata should follow every rule, with as few exceptions as possible. There are no currently known exceptions, although itâ€™s possible I could be forgetting something.  
- Ease of speaking \- Avanzata is designed to be spoken quickly with minimal effort, and with flexible pronunciation rules.  
- Flexible grammar \- Sentences in Avanzata can be constructed in a variety of ways as long as the point is clear.  
- Intuitive vocabulary: When translating a new word to Avanzata, one can usually just adapt the equivalent word from a Romance language into Avanzata using cognate rules.  
- Ease of typing: Avanzata uses the Latin alphabet without accent marks to facilitate ease of typing.

### Drawbacks  
Like any language, Avanzata is not perfect. The most important of these imperfections are listed as follows:

- Complex syllable stress rules: Because Avanzata uses a moraic timing system with primarily Latin-based vocabulary, achieving consistency required the creation of several potentially difficult rules regarding syllable stress.  
- Complex pronunciation rules: Certain letters, especially R, can be pronounced multiple ways depending on the situation.
